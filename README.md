# Springboot to Native Running Container

## Objective show in 1 hour some common spring layers and turning that code into a native running container

## [The talk that was recorded available on YoutTube that produced this project]() 

- Note at the end of the talk and where we did not have time to debug was the missing Joke object not found in the
  native compiled. This is resolved by adding the needed entry in the
  reflect-config.json [feflect-config](src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/reflect-config.json)

## Layers of the simple Quote Service

![Layers of this application](quote.png)

### Steps taken to accomplish this project.

- Visit chuck norris joke site https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category=dev to see output.
- QuoteApplication the starting point for the WebFlux application.
- Config Class to retrieve joke in reactive call.
    - Write the Test for the renderApiErrorResponse for the Filter in the Reactive webclient.
        - Do not want to expose the chuck api to the calling client when errors take place.
        - We also want to log it so we can debug and do RCA.
- Joke Record to store the returned joke and log its original url.
- QuoteService Interface the contract to retrieve quote with supplied name.
- Specific Concrete implementation NameReplaceQuoteGenerator Class implements QuoteService using chuck norris website to
  supply the verbiage.
    - Write the Test for this specific implementation that replaces chuck with supplied name in chuck joke.
- Quote Record the contract to the outside Rest contract.
- WebFlux QuoteController Class to return the Quote to the caller.
    - Write the Controller test to make sure different names would be replaced
        - Take note that this test only tests out the flow not the actually replacing. very nice showing layer
          separation.
- Build the application using the [Native Build Starter image thanks to Mark Sailes](native-builder-starter.sh) base
  image is AWS runtime linux.
- Build docker image for Quote Service [Script to build the docker image](docker/image.sh) this uses the produced binary
  built on the AWS linux in docker from last step.
- Run the container using [Run Container Script](run-container.sh) see how fast the image starts up.
